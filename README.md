# LocalBuzz.ai – Event Intelligence for Local Businesses

**LocalBuzz.ai** is a trend analytics tool that helps event planners, decorators, and local service providers stay ahead by monitoring real-time search intent, public chatter, and regional interest in event-related topics.

## Problem

Event businesses often rely on guesswork or outdated patterns. But trends shift fast — from theme ideas to seasonal demand and cultural influences.

**What if they had access to what people are actually searching for or asking online — in real time?**

## Solution

**LocalBuzz.ai** scrapes and analyzes *public data* across multiple platforms to surface actionable insights:

- What events are trending in your locality?
- What are people struggling with while planning?
- Which services are in demand this month?

## How It Works

1. **Data Sources** (Ethical & Legal):
   - Reddit threads (e.g., r/kerala, r/wedding)
   - Quora questions
   - Public event blogs and forums
   - Instagram & X (Twitter) hashtags
   - Google Trends / YouTube Trends (optional APIs)

2. **Tech Stack:**
   - `Python` (Scrapy / BeautifulSoup / Playwright)
   - `NLP` (spaCy or BERT) for trend extraction and keyword clustering
   - `Django` or `Flask` backend
   - `React.js` dashboard UI
   - Optional: `Firebase` or `MongoDB` for fast retrieval

3. **Features:**
   - Regional filter (e.g., Kochi, Malappuram, Calicut)
   - Trending themes with keyword cloud
   - Top pain points/questions from users
   - Event calendar heatmap
   - Export to CSV or Notion
